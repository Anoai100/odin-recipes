    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Air frying is the best way to cook tender chicken in less time, since there's no preheating the oven. And with my simple seasoning blend, these flavorful chicken breasts not only make an easy weeknight dinner, but they're perfect for meal prep too. This recipe results in super flavorful, tender chicken breasts with no brining!
